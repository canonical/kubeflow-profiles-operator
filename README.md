# Charmed Kubeflow Profiles
Charmed Kubeflow Profiles is the charm that implements the Kubeflow profile controller, which manages user Profiles. These Profiles enable [Kubeflow Multi-Tenancy](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/concepts/multi-tenancy/) to allow for multi-user isolation. For more information on managing profiles, refer to the relevant Charmed Kubeflow [documentation](https://charmed-kubeflow.io/docs/manage-profiles).
